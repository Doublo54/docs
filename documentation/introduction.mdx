Welcome to the Zap Product Documentation! This guide will provide you with everything you need to know about our innovative zap solution.
Our zap technology allows you to seamlessly convert a single token into a Liquidity Pool (LP) token and optionally, further integrate it into specific protocols.
This streamlined process simplifies the user experience and maximizes efficiency in managing your crypto assets.

There are two main methods to utilize the Zap

**Single Token To LP**

It allows users to go from a single token to a liquidity provider (LP) token in a single transaction. Before Zap, users had to manually acquire both tokens of an LP pair, then combine them to receive a LP token that represented that LP pair.

**Single Token To Protocol**

This feature enables users to directly zap into a protocol product (e.g. purchase ApeBond bonds) using a single token, simplifying the process significantly.
